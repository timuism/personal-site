Happy new year! **I know it is the end of January**, *and therefore I'm saying this about a month too late, but it is never too* late to start a blog and redesign your site. 

I set this site up last summer as a quick portfolio for a job that I was applying for (and that I now have ðŸ˜ƒ). And I'm happy to say that I really love this new position and it has brought a new level of excitement to me with web development. So here I am, going into February with the intention of developing my web development career.

The site I threw together was made with Gatsby. I recently stumbled across Astro (probably via Twitter) and liked the sound of it. I'm happy to say that I loved putting this site together and their documentation made it extremely easy to do so.

Because of how great their documentation is, I would walk through the entire process of setting it up:

## Planning + Designing

## Installing Astro

## Installing Tailwind

## Setting up Styles 

## Creating the Base Layout

## Putting together the Posts view

## Building the Post page

## Styling Tweaks + Finishing Touches

## Code Highlighting with Prism
